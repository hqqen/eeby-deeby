Note: depending on exactly how you implement your model and what batch size you use, i.e., one point at a time, or some subset of data points, values of $\\alpha$ anywhere between around 0.7 and 0.01 should be sufficient to converge the model in under 1000 epochs, i.e., passes through the dataset. If you implement more advanced tricks covered in some optional readings this can converge much faster, but that is not necessary for this assignment, and it does not matter to me how quickly your model coverges, so long as it does so.\n",
